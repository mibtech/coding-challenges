# Software Engineer - Frontend

## Objective
Develop a reusable, structured, and well-designed *autocomplete* component using [MUI Base UI](https://mui.com/base-ui/react-autocomplete/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite), and **TypeScript**, inspired by [MUI's autocomplete](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-autocomplete/)'s API/features.

#### Important notes

- Put maximum effort into coding style and naming, as these are evaluated first.
- The goal of this test is more to evaluate the way of thinking, design, and quality of code.
- Focus on building a small and concise app the right way using software engineering principles and best practices.
- MUI's autocomplete has many features; you can choose as many as you find relevant for this test.
- Once you're done with the test, share the link by email to **a.elfannir@mibtech.ma**.

The goal of this challenge is to evaluate the way of thinking, the quality of code design, and the accuracy to read and follow instructions. It is also considered a first onboarding step to join MibTech.

We accept juniors and seniors.

## Evaluation Criteria ðŸš¨

- Accuracy in following instructions.
- Adherence to software engineering principles: DRY, KISS, YAGNI, SOLID.
- Code readability and architecture design.
- Clean commit history in Git, making code review easy. Push progressively instead of pushing the whole project in a single commit.
- Quality of documentation (The README should be short and concise; get inspired by open source projects' READMEs).

## Instructions

- Focus more on code quality and less on speed.
- Avoid quick hacks; take your time to craft something clean, with layers, separation of concerns, and good frontend practices.
- Write readable and maintainable code.
- Consider reusability of components when appropriate.
