## Objective
Develop a reusable, structured, and well-designed *autocomplete* component using [MUI Base UI](https://mui.com/base-ui/react-autocomplete/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite), Inspired from [MUI's autocomplete](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-autocomplete/)

#### Important notes

- Put maximum effort on the coding style and naming, these are evaluated first.
- The goal of this test is more to evaluate the way of thinking, design and quality of code.
- Focus to build a small and concise app the right way using software engineering principles and best practices.
- MUI's autocomplete has a ton of features, you can pick as much as you can for this test
- Once you're done with the test, let us know by sharing the link by email to **a.elfannir@mibtech.ma**.

The goal of this challenge is to evaluate the way of thinking, the quality of code design, and the accuracy to read and follow instructions.
It's also considered as first onboarding step to join mibtech.

We accept juniors and seniors.

## Evaluation criteria ðŸš¨

- Accuracy to follow instructions.
- Respect of software engineering principles : DRY, KISS, YAGNI, SOLID.
- Code readability and architecture design.
- Clean commit history in git making code review easy, push progressively instead of pushing the whole project in a single commit.
- Quality of documentation (The readme should be short and concise, get inspired from open source projects readme).

## Instructions

- Put more focus on code quality and less on speed. 
- Don't hack something quickly, take your time and craft something clean, with layers, separation of concerns and with following good frontend practices.
- Write a readable and maintainable code.
- Think about re-usable component when it's accurate.
